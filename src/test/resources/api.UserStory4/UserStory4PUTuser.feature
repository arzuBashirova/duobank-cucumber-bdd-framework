Feature: User Story 4 â€“ PUT /user

  As a mortgage application user,
  I want to be able to update my personal information through an API endpoint,
  so that my information is accurate and up-to-date.

     }
     """
    When I send a "PUT" request to the endpoint "/user".
    Then the response status code should be 200
