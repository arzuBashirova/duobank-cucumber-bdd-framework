#      Given The user is on the Personal Information page of the mortgage application
@DB
      Scenario: Store the users personal information
        When user logins to the website
        Then user should click "Mortgage Application" button
        Then user should fill Preapproval Details info
        Then user should fill out borrower's and co-borrower's personal information
        Then databse should store borrower's and co-borroser's personal information

@DB_now
  Scenario: Table in db should have columns

  When users added personal information
  Then database should have columns
